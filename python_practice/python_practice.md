comment: Use the basics of Python coding, data transformation, and data visualization to work with real data. 
long_description: When learning Python for data science, the ultimate goal is to be able to put all of the pieces together to analyze a dataset. This module aims to present a data science task in order to help learners practice Python skills in a real-world context. 
estimated_time: 1 hour

@learning_objectives

After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- Import a dataset from an online database
- Recode data and change variable types in a dataframe
- Use exploratory data visualization to identify trends in data and generate hypotheses

## Overview
@comment

**Is this module right for me?:** @long_description

**Estimated time to completion:** @estimated_time

**Pre-requisites:** Learners should be familiar with Python coding (https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/python_basics_writing_python_code/python_basics_writing_python_code.md), including data transformation with pandas (https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/pandas_transform/pandas_transform.md) and data transformation with seaborn (https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/data_visualization_in_seaborn/data_visualization_in_seaborn.md). Learners should also have access to Python, either on their own computer or in the cloud. 

**Learning Objectives**:

## Lesson Preparation

For this module, you'll need access to Python, either on your own computer or in the cloud. For details about how to download Python or use Google Colab (a cloud-based notebook environment), you can take a look at the ["Accessing Python" section of our Demystifying Python module](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/demystifying_python/demystifying_python.md#9). 

## The Data

For this practice module we will be using real, publicly-available cervical cancer data from [UC Irvine's machine learning data repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php); you can download those data here: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00383/risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00383/risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv). If you have done the R Practice Module (**link required**), this dataset might be familiar! 

## Topics to Review

- Importing Python libraries 
- Reading a CSV and creating a data frame
- Editing/recoding data
- Exploratory data visualization

## Practice Problem

According to the UCI Machine Learning database, the Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) dataset "focuses on the prediction of indicators/diagnosis of cervical cancer. The features cover demographic information, habits, and historic medical records." Your tasks are to explore this dataset ad use the Python tools that you've learned so far to develop a hypothesis about some likely risk factors for a diagnosis of cervical cancer.  

Remember that there are several ways to approach this task; there is no one right answer! So have fun, and good luck!

### Stuck? 

If this practice problem was challenging, [here is a link to an example notebook]() where we go through one possible solution to the practice problem. We encourage you to spend some time playing around with the data before you look at the example! And remember, just because your solution doesn't look exactly like the example doesn't mean it's wrong-- there are a variety of ways you might have approached the task we gave you.
