# Module Updates

As an author, you create a high quality module and contribute it to our project.  That's a generous and important donation of time and materials.  As time goes on, almost every module will need updating.  This is inevitable and does not reflect lack of commitment or quality in the original material.

Updating can take place because of changes to the topic.  For example: software is updated and code samples or screenshots need to be changed, better methods emerge and should be included, or trends and usage of particular libraries or packages change over time.  Updates can also happen because of external factors that don't have to do with the topic *per se*. Linked articles cease to exist and need to be replaced, for instance, or the infrastructure that allows for in-browser coding changes.  A module may also need to be updated to account for bugs or other quality issues.  Quiz questions might be tweaked to reflect feedback from learners, for example, or typos or broken links fixed.

This need for updating and maintenance on an ongoing basis can prove problematic for modules contributed by authors who are not core staff who work together daily.  You may be too busy to make suggested changes, or your interests may have changed and you're just not interested in continuing to donate your labor to continual improvement.  We may not have the most up-to-date contact information for you and might not even be able to reach you to inform you about desired changes.

## Updates You Initiate

If at any point you wish to suggest a change to a module you wrote, please let us know! You can send us an email at dart@chop.edu, or [post an issue](https://github.com/arcus/education_modules/issues/new/choose) to let us know what should be changed. 

We will take your suggestions into account and use them at our discretion.  If at any point the module diverges from your vision and you prefer that the attribution be changed, you can request us to change the attribution to be a co-authorship between you and DART staff or ask us to make this attribution a generic "DART contributor" attribution and remove your name from the module. 

## Updates We Initiate

### Small Changes

If you submit a module to us, you agree that we can make small changes to your work without informing you or changing the attribution of the module to you.  These small changes include improvements intended to optimize or correct content or behavior of the module and do not substantially modify your message or language.  Examples could be updating screenshots, correcting typos, or rearranging content for better flow.

### Substantial Changes 

If we have more substantial changes, which would alter more than 20% of the module contents (estimated by number of lines altered) or would introduce changes that we believe alter the original intent or message of the module, we will proceed according to one of three options.  You can choose the option that you prefer us to follow in the case of your module when you submit your module for inclusion in our materials.

**Option 1: We change without alerting you.**  We make changes as we see fit.  If, at some future time, you notice that the changes diverge from your vision and you prefer that the attribution be changed, you can request us to change the attribution to be a co-authorship between you and DART staff or ask us to make this attribution a generic "DART contributor" attribution and remove your name from the module.  

**Option 2: We change and inform.** We make the changes as we see fit and inform you via a mention in GitHub and via email to any email address you list in the module metadata. You may offer suggestions in response to our changes, which we will take into account and use at our discretion.  If the changes diverge from your vision and you prefer that the attribution be changed, you can request us to change the attribution to be a co-authorship between you and DART staff or ask us to make this attribution a generic "DART contributor" attribution and remove your name from the module.  

**Option 3: You have a chance to offer changes, we finalize and inform.**  We offer you, depending on the urgency of the changes, a period of time to improve / alter the module on a new git branch to meet the requirements we state.  We will inform you of the requirements and need for updating via a GitHub mention as well as via email to any email address you list in the module metadata.  The later of these communications starts the clock for your time to contribute your updates.  This period of time will be 7 calendar days for urgent changes or 21 calendar days for non-urgent changes.  At the end of that time, we will use your branch as a starting point for improvements to the module and will make necessary changes, attempting to honor your suggestions.  We will inform you when changes are complete. You may offer suggestions in response to our changes, which we will take into account and use at our discretion.  If the changes diverge from your vision and you prefer that the attribution be changed, you can request us to change the attribution to be a co-authorship between you and DART staff or ask us to make this attribution a generic "DART contributor" attribution and remove your name from the module.  

Please note that although we need a clear and consistent policy on our end so we're able to implement needed changes on a reasonable timetable, we understand that sometimes life gets in the way! If you receive a message from us about necessary changes to a module you wrote and you miss the window to offer changes, you are still very welcome to reach out after that time with suggestions. Depending on the situation, we may not be able to implement them, but we are always grateful for your input. 

## Additional Notes 

Note that because you have donated this material to us, we maintain the right to preserve your module in perpetuity, unless doing so would cause harm to our learners.  

We reserve the right to unpublish or substantially alter without notice any module that includes illegal or harmful information.
