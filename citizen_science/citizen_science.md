## What is citizen science?

Citizen science is a broad term that is used to describe scientific projects that invite participation from the public in any of a number of ways.
Some of the ways citizen scientists can participate in a project include the following:

- collect data ([Alabama Water Watch](https://aaes.auburn.edu/alabamawaterwatch/); [eBird](https://science.ebird.org/en))
- text coding, such as in the creation of training data for machine learning algorithms ([Injury Coding](https://github.com/NASA-Tournament-Lab/CDC-NLP-Occ-Injury-Coding))
- image analysis ([Placenta Profiles](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/msbrhonclif/science-scribbler-placenta-profiles/about/research))
- problem solving ([Hewman game](https://citizensciencegames.com/games/hewmen/))
- writing and debugging code, including complex data science projects ([EvidentlyAI's Hacktoberfest](https://www.evidentlyai.com/hacktoberfest-2022))
- donate spare CPU time for computationally intense analyses ([FoldingatHome](https://foldingathome.org/))

Read [an interview with biologist Caren Cooper](https://e360.yale.edu/features/interview_caren_cooper_how_rise_of_citizen_science_is_democratizing_research) about her experience with several citizen science projects, including what she's learned about how participating in citizen science can impact individuals and communities.

</div>

Citizen science is attractive to many researchers not only because of the possibility of outsourcing work on large complex data, but because it provides the potential to democratize science and allow the public more influence over and involvement in the scientific process.


<div class = "learn-more">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Learning connection</b><br>

Some projects focus especially on how public involvement in science can put power back in the hands of communities.
For example, Public Lab works to pursue environmental justice through community science and open technology. From the [Public Lab About page](https://publiclab.org/about):

"When people can easily and reliably track local effects associated with environmental injustices — increased flooding, poor air quality, pollution and destruction of wetlands — they can make better-informed decisions and take action."

</div>


The prevalence of citizen science has increased dramatically in recent years, especially as more digital platforms emerge to support it (for example [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/), [Globe at Night](https://www.globeatnight.org/), [Foldit](https://fold.it/), and [The Many Brains Project](https://www.testmybrain.org/)).


<div class = "history">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Historical context</b><br>

[What Is Citizen Science? – A Scientometric Meta-Analysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147152) explores the history of citizen science projects, including which fields make the most use of citizen science and what scientific output they have produced.
It includes a meta-analysis of more than 2000 published papers.

</div>

## Why participate in citizen science?

Citizen scientists vary a tremendous amount in terms of the level of dedication they bring to a project, their expertise, and their motivation for participating.
In some cases, participants are attracted just by the prospect of contributing to a scientific project, especially if it's an issue they care about.
They also may be motivated by helping their community or themselves with the output of the research.


Other times, the project is [designed as a game](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0100662) or includes more traditional incentives like money to attract participants.
Some platforms encourage engagement by letting users track their contributions, earn points, and even [form teams to compete against other volunteers](https://stats.foldingathome.org/).


There are many possible reasons to donate time and effort to a project, and different reasons may apply for different kinds of projects as well as different citizen scientists.

<div class = "learn-more">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Learning connection</b><br>

Check out this recent article exploring the reasons people participated in a citizen science project:

[Why (not) participate in citizen science? Motivational factors and barriers to participate in a citizen science program for malaria control in Rwanda](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237396)

</div>

As you learn about new citizen science projects, read their recruitment materials and think about what kinds of motivation they're attempting to tap into to attract citizen scientists.

## How to build a citizen science project

Large citizen science projects take a substantial effort to get off the ground but are worthwhile because they pay dividends for a long time once they reach a certain momentum.
It may take years before a project produces valuable scientific output.
Successful projects often rely on grant funding to pay for dedicated staff.

For a quicker start, see if there's an existing project you can join rather than starting your own.
If you can contribute time and expertise to an existing project, it may be possible for you to add tests or experiments to their ongoing work.

<div class = "learn-more">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Learning connection</b><br>

For an idea of what might be involved in setting up a larger project, see the [Federal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Toolkit](https://www.citizenscience.gov/toolkit/#) published by the U.S. government.

</div>

A more reasonable option for researchers looking to get started with citizen science is to post a project on an existing platform, like [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/lab).

***
<div class = "answer">

All of these are reasons people put their time and effort towards citizen science projects!

As you learn about new citizen science projects, notice the language they use on their recruitment materials and think about what kinds of motivation they're attempting to tap into.
If you start your own citizen science project, carefully consider what might best motivate your participants.

</div>
***

True or False: There are platforms available online to help you launch new citizen science projects quickly.

[(X)] TRUE
[( )] FALSE
***
<div class = "answer">

True!
The largest online platform is [the Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/about), but there are many others.
As you learn about new citizen science projects, notice where they're hosted, or, if you can't tell, reach out to the organizers to ask them about how they set up their project.

</div>
***

Go to [TestMyBrain.org](https://testmybrain.org/about.html).  Can you, as a researcher, get access to the tests and quizzes used on the site to run your own studies?

[(X)] Yes
[( )] No
***
<div class = "answer">

Yes, they provide a special version of their website for use by researchers wanting to use their tests and quizzes.
For more information, see their [research page](https://testmybrain.org/research.html). They also have more information about collaboration at [The Many Brains Project](https://www.manybrains.net/work-with-us).

Many large citizen science projects invite collaboration.
If you're curious about whether you could contribute, or if you're interested in obtaining the data, code, or materials for an existing citizen science project, it's worth reaching out to the organizers!

Read the abstract of this [journal article about using citizen science to identify novel drug targets for tuberculosis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039808) to get an overview of the study. Why might the authors have opted to make this a citizen science project rather than using more traditional methods?

[[the research question required a tremendous amount of work that could be done without special training]]

(Note that we can't automatically grade open ended answers to quiz questions, so the page will say your answer was correct no matter what you typed.)

There are many potential reasons to start a citizen science project, but for the authors of this article, the primary reason was the scope of the work required to answer their research question.

They needed many, many hours of annotation of the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* genome in order to identify potential drug targets.
Because this work could be done by people without special training, it was a good candidate for crowd sourcing.

Read the abstract of this [journal article about the development of a tool for malaria diagnosis using citizen science](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037245). True or False: The authors present classification of blood smear images by non-expert humans as a cheaper way to replace to machine learning algorithms.

[( )] TRUE
[(X)] FALSE
***
<div class = "answer">

False.
They tried both machine learning and classification by non-expert humans as alternatives to analysis by trained experts with the goal of making diagnosis faster, cheaper, and more widely available.

If you read further in the article, you'll find they did compare the human coders to a machine learning algorithm to see which did a better job classifying blood smears, and they found that their non-expert human participants did classify the images with more success than the machine learning algorithm they tested.
In this case, machine learning solutions for automatic detection of infected red blood cells have struggled because of the variability in images.
The human visual system is much better adapted to see past the irrelevant variation and identify the key characteristics of infected vs. healthy cells, so this is a situation where untrained humans out perform machine learning tools.

One neat thing about their approach, though, is that it suggests the possibility for using the human and machine systems productively together --- as the humans generate a larger and larger database of classified images, the machine learning algorithm can learn on a larger and larger training dataset, which will likely improve its performance.

This is one of several studies showing how citizen science and machine learning can be used together.
