## What is citizen science?

Citizen science is a broad term that is used to describe scientific projects that invite participation from the public in any of a number of ways.
Some of the ways citizen scientists can participate in a project include the following:

- collect data ([Alabama Water Watch](https://aaes.auburn.edu/alabamawaterwatch/); [eBird](https://science.ebird.org/en))
- text coding, such as in the creation of training data for machine learning algorithms ([Injury Coding](https://github.com/NASA-Tournament-Lab/CDC-NLP-Occ-Injury-Coding))
- image analysis ([Placenta Profiles](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/msbrhonclif/science-scribbler-placenta-profiles/about/research))
- problem solving ([Hewman game](https://citizensciencegames.com/games/hewmen/))
- writing and debugging code, including complex data science projects ([EvidentlyAI's Hacktoberfest](https://www.evidentlyai.com/hacktoberfest-2022))
- donate spare CPU time for computationally intense analyses ([Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/))


<div class = "learn-more">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Learning connection</b><br>

Read [an interview with biologist Caren Cooper](https://e360.yale.edu/features/interview_caren_cooper_how_rise_of_citizen_science_is_democratizing_research) about her experience with several citizen science projects, including what she's learned about how participating in citizen science can impact individuals and communities.

</div>

Citizen science is attractive to many researchers not only because of the possibility of outsourcing work on large complex data, but because it provides the potential to democratize science and allow the public more influence over and involvement in the scientific process.


<div class = "learn-more">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Learning connection</b><br>

Some projects focus especially on how public involvement in science can put power back in the hands of communities.
For example, [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/) works to pursue environmental justice through community science and open technology: "When people can easily and reliably track local effects associated with environmental injustices — increased flooding, poor air quality, pollution and destruction of wetlands — they can make better-informed decisions and take action.""

</div>


The prevalence of citizen science has increased dramatically in recent years, especially as more digital platforms emerge to support it (for example [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/), [Globe at Night](https://www.globeatnight.org/), [Foldit](https://fold.it/), and [The Many Brains Project](https://www.testmybrain.org/)).


<div class = "history">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Historical context</b><br>

[What Is Citizen Science? – A Scientometric Meta-Analysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147152) explores the history of citizen science projects, including which fields make the most use of citizen science and what scientific output they have produced.
It includes a meta-anlaysis of more than 2000 published studies.

</div>

## Who participates in citizen science?

Citizen scientists vary a tremendous amount in terms of the level of dedication they bring to a project, their expertise, and their motivation for participating.
In some cases, participants are attracted just by the prospect of contributing to a scientific project, especially if it's on an issue they care about.
Other times, the project is [designed as a game](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0100662) or includes more traditional incentives like money to attract participants.
There are many possible reasons to donate time and effort to a project, and different reasons may apply for different kinds of projects as well as different citizen scientists.

<div class = "learn-more">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Learning connection</b><br>

Check out this recent article exploring the reasons people participated in a citizen science project:

[Why (not) participate in citizen science? Motivational factors and barriers to participate in a citizen science program for malaria control in Rwanda](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237396)

</div>

As you learn about new citizen science projects, read their recruitment materials and think about what kinds of motivation they're attempting to tap into to attract citizen scientists.

## How to build a citizen science project

Many citizen science projects take a long time to get off the ground but are worthwhile because they pay dividends for a long time once they reach a certain momentum.
It may take years before a project produces valuable scientific output.
Successful projects often rely on grant funding to pay for dedicated staff.

See if there's an existing project you can join rather than starting your own.
If you can contribute time and expertise to an existing project, it may be possible for you to add tests or experiments to their ongoing work.

For an idea of what might be involved in setting up a larger project, see the [Federal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Toolkit](https://www.citizenscience.gov/toolkit/#) published by the U.S. government.

A more reasonable option for researchers looking to get started with citizen science is to post a project on an existing platform, like [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/lab).


## Quiz: Citizen Science

Which of the following are ways citizen scientists can help a project? Check all that apply.

[[X]] data/sample collection
[[X]] data coding
[[X]] scientific programming
[[X]] donating computing power
***
<div class = "answer">
These are all examples of how citizens can support scientific discovery!
</div>
***

Which of the following might motivate someone to participate as a citizen scientist? Check all that apply.

[[X]] learning something interesting
[[X]] wanting to be involved in science
[[X]] payment or gift incentives
[[X]] fun
[[X]] competitiveness
[[X]] wanting to give back to their community
[[X]] wanting support an important cause
***
<div class = "answer">
All of these are reasons people put their time and effort towards citizen science projects!
As you learn about new citizen science projects, notice the language they use on their recruitment materials and think about what kinds of motivation they're attempting to tap into.
If you start your own citizen science project, carefully consider what might best motivate your participants.

Go to [TestMyBrain.org](https://testmybrain.org/about.html).  Can you, as a researcher, get access to the tests and quizzes used on the site to run your own studies?

[(X)] Yes
[( )] No
***
<div class = "answer">
Yes, they provide a special version of their website for use by researchers wanting to use their tests and quizzes.
For more information, see their [research page](https://testmybrain.org/research.html).

Read the abstract of this [journal article about using citizen science to identify novel drug targets for tuberculosis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039808). Why did the authors opt to make this a citizen science project rather than using more traditional methods?

[[the research question required a tremendous amount of work that could be done without special training]]
<script>
  let input = "@input".trim();
  /./i.test(input);
</script>
***
<div class = "answer">
(Note that we can't automatically grade open ended answers to quiz questions, so the page will say your answer was correct no matter what you typed.)

There are many potential reasons to start a citizen science project, but for the authors of this article, the primary reason was the scope of the work required to answer their research question.
They needed many, many hours of annotation of the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* genome in order to identify potential drug targets.
Because this work could be done by people without special training, it was a good candidate for crowd sourcing.

</div>
***

Read the abstract of this [journal article about the development of a tool for malaria diagnosis using citizen science](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037245). True or False: The authors hypothesized that non-expert humans would be able to out perform machine learning algorithms on classification of blood smear images.

[(X)] TRUE
[( )] FALSE
***
<div class = "answer">

True! In this case, machine learning solutions for automatic detection of infected red blood cells have struggled because of the variability in images.
The human visual system is much better adapted to see past the irrelevant variation and identify the key characteristics of infected vs. healthy cells, so this is a situation where untrained humans might out perform machine learning tools.

The authors found that their non-expert human participants did classify the images with more success than the machine learning algorithm they tested.
One neat thing about their approach, though, is that it suggests the possibility for using the human and machine systems productively together --- as the humans generate a larger and larger database of classified images, the machine learning algorithm can learn on a larger and larger training dataset, which will likely improve its performance.

This is one of several studies showing how citizen science and machine learning can be used together.

</div>
***

- Can you download the data obtained from participants using the site?
- Can you, as a researcher, get access to identifiable participant data (i.e. data that links a participant's responses to the test and quizzes with identifying information about them like their email address)?

## Including highlight boxes

Include special notes with different formatting.

Note: There's an additional style of highlight not listed here, "answer", that is used in [quizzes](#quiz-quizzes).


### behind-the-scenes

The style "behind-the-scenes" is for giving a little more technical detail about how something does what it does.
It has a gears icon and always begins with the text "Behind the scenes".
For example:

<div class = "behind-the-scenes">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Behind the scenes</b><br>

The commit number is a hash and associated details

</div>

<div class = "behind-the-scenes">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Behind the scenes</b><br>

In R the `<-` and `=` can both be used for assignment because...

</div>

### care

The style "care" is for content related to compassion, self-care, and motivation. For more technical help or troubleshooting, use "help" instead.
It has a hand-holding-heart icon and always begins with the text "A little encouragement..."
For example:

<div class = "care">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">A little encouragement...</b><br>

This is a topic with a tremendous amount of jargon, which can make resources you may find online hard to understand for folks new to the field. When that happens it's easy to feel like there's something wrong with you if you don't get it, but that's not the case! Those kinds of gatekeeping explanations are a failure on the part of the writer, not the learner.

</div>

<div class = "care">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">A little encouragement...</b><br>

Feeling overwhelmed? It takes a long time to learn git, so don't be disheartened if it doesn't click initially. Just focus on stage, commit, and push. Ignore the rest for now, until you've had a chance to practice just the stage-commit-push process several times.

</div>

### cool-fact

The style "cool-fact" is for any cool fact that really doesn't fit into any of our other categories.
It has a brain icon and always begins with the text "Did you know?"
For example:

<div class = "cool-fact">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Did you know?</b><br>

Functions like this are sometimes called "syntactic sugar" because they don't change anything about how the code runs, they just make it easier for humans to read, the way that sugar makes food sweeter without adding any nutrition.

</div>


<div class = "cool-fact">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Did you know?</b><br>

This is a box showing how images work in a highlight box.

</div>


### help

The style "help" is for troubleshooting help, common errors, and specific technical problems. If you want to emphasize a very serious potential problem, use "warning" instead. For support that is more psycho/emotional or meta-learning in nature, use "care" instead.
It has a circle-question icon and always begins with the text "Troubleshooting help".
For example:

<div class = "help">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Troubleshooting help</b><br>

A common mistake when using `filter` is to write = when you mean ==. Remember that = is for argument assignment, and == is for testing equality in conditions. If you get them mixed up, your code won't run!

</div>

### history

The style "history" is for more historical context about how/when/why something came to be the way it currently is.
It has a clock-rotate-left icon and always begins with the text "Historical context".
For example:

<div class = "history">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Historical context</b><br>

The reason this command is named grep is...

</div>

<div class = "history">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Historical context</b><br>

The first README file was from 1971, etc.

</div>


### important

The style "important" is for important points and key ideas.
It has a star icon and always begins with the text "Important note".
For example:

<div class = "important">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Important note</b><br>

It's generally much easier to make any necessary changes to the dataframe, such as mutating variables, before sending it to the plotting command.

</div>

### learn-more

The style "learn-more" alerts users resources for further learning, especially links to a more in-depth discussion of an issue that might be touched on only briefly in the module. It can link to outside sources, or other modules by us.
It has a book icon and always begins with the text "Learning connection".
For example:

<div class = "learn-more">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Learning connection</b><br>

To learn more about the theory behind ggplot2, read [Hadley Wickham's article, "A Layered Grammar of Graphics"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf).

</div>


<div class = "learn-more">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Learning connection</b><br>

To do this in R instead of python, see [this other module](example.com).

</div>


### options

The style "options" is for an aside to let learners know there's another possible approach. This is for short explanations rather than linked resources; to link to another approach (e.g. here's a tutorial for another way to do this), use "learn-more" instead.
It has a left-right arrow icon and always begins with the text "Another option".
For example:

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>

You could also skip setting up an OSF account completely and just use github to publish and share your research products, but many people prefer to have OSF links available.

</div>

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>

You can run this in the cloud or download all of the files locally and run it on your computer. If you run it on your computer, be sure to make note of which directory you save the files in and update your working directory accordingly.

</div>

### warning

The style "warning" alerts users to potential pitfalls, and should be reserved for serious problems only. For less serious problems, use "help" instead.
It has a ! triangle icon and always begins with the text "Warning!".
For example:

<div class = "warning">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Warning!</b><br>

Double check your working directory before running this code. If you're in the wrong directory, you risk overwriting your files and losing all of your work with no way to recover it.

</div>

<div class = "warning">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Warning!</b><br>

Files uploaded to this account will be **publicly visible**. Be very careful not to upload anything with sensitive information like passwords or private data.

</div>

## Including math

I want to include a math statement here: $ 1 + \beta = 2 $

## Including code

Next comes some code. This code won't do anything (it's not interactive).

```r
# You only need to install it once
install.packages("ggplot2")

# You'll need to load the library anew for each R session
library("ggplot2")
```
You don't have to specify the programming language, but you can, and it should help you get appropriate syntax highlighting.

```python
print("This is python code")
```

It is possible to include interactive code, too! See [the Rextester template for LiaScript](https://github.com/LiaTemplates/Rextester).

## Quiz: Quizzes

Quizzes are just more markdown text, so if you want it to show up on its own page, put a new header before it. Otherwise you can include quiz questions at the end of a section, or even interspersed with the rest of your content.

Quizzes should connect directly to your learning objectives. Each quiz question should connect to one learning objective, and every learning objective should have at least one quiz question associated with it somewhere in the module.

Quizzes should always be navigable from the sidebar, meaning they should be labeled with a level 2 or 3 header. If there is only one quiz in the module, it should be labelled as "Quiz". If there is more than one each header should be structured as "Quiz: label" where "label" is a short (ideally 1-2 words) description of the content covered in the question(s). E.g., "Quiz: Scatterplots"

Here is the first question. It's multiple choice.

[(X)] This answer is right
[( )] This is wrong
[( )] Also wrong
[[?]] Hint: Provide a hint here if you like. Hints are marked with the ?
[[?]] Hint: You can include as many hints as you want.

You can have questions with multiple correct answers. Select all of the following correct choices:

[[ ]] Not this one
[[X]] This is one of the correct ones
[[X]] Here's another correct one
[[ ]] This one is wrong, though
[[?]] Hint: Remember to select ALL of the correct choices.

True or False: This statement is NOT true. ;)

[( )] TRUE
[(X)] FALSE

Short answer/text response. Note that, without any additional script, to get it marked "correct" the learner has to enter it exactly as you do.

[[right answer]]
[[?]] Hint: The answer is "right answer"
***
<div class = "answer">

This is extra text that will show up after the learner clicks to have the correct answer revealed. It can be as long as you like, and allows any markdown formatting (you can embed pictures or videos, links, etc.).

Use `<div class = "answer">` to mark these sections with special styling, so that they're visually distinct from the rest of the quiz. The style for `"answer"` is defined in the css file.

For this context to show up automatically when the learner answers the question correctly or clicks to have the right answer revealed, it needs to be surrounded by `***` (at least three, but you can use more if you want a more visually distinct horizontal marker in your md file).

</div>
***

We can allow some flexibility in what we accept as correct answers for text by adding a little script after the answer, though. For the following, either "right answer" or "correct answer" (not case sensitive) will be accepted:

[[right answer]]
<script>
  let input = "@input".trim().toLowerCase();
  input == "right answer" || input == "correct answer";
</script>
***
<div class = "answer">

For this question, either "right answer" or "correct answer" (not case sensitive) counts as correct.

</div>
***

This question accepts any of several items from a list of possible correct answers. It is not case sensitive (that's the little `i` at the end of the regex).

[[this text will never show up if they type a right answer and click "Check", only if they click the checkmark button to reveal the answer]]
[[?]] Hint: The answers are like "item1", "item2", etc.
<script>
  let input = "@input".trim();
  /item1|item2|item3|item4/i.test(input);
</script>
***
<div class = "answer">

With flexible answers like this, it's definitely a good idea to include a follow-up to help the learner put their answer in context.

For example, if the question was "Name one or more colors" with acceptable answers including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple, and they wrote "red, green, and the center of a black hole" that would be marked as correct because it contains at least one string from the acceptable list. Similarly, "hammered metal" would be marked as correct because it contains the string "red" ([you can prevent this if you want](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regexp_begin.asp)). On the other hand "teal, scarlet, indigo" would be marked wrong.

Reiterate what the correct answer or answers should be, and try to anticipate likely wrong answers so you can explain why they're not correct.

</div>
***

There are also questions that allow you to select from a drop down, but I don't know why that would be preferable over regular multiple choice. [Read more about quiz syntax here.](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md#quizzes)

Note that you can use any markdown formatting you want in quizzes, including bold, links, math, etc.

Surveys (ungraded questions)
---

You can ask questions with no graded answer as well. LiaScript calls these [surveys](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaScript/docs/master/README.md#111).

Here's an ungraded question with a text box three lines long:

[[___ ___ ___]]

Here's one that's just one line long:

[[___]]

Here's a multiple choice with no correct answer. What is your favorite Beatles album?

[(rev)] Revolver
[(wa)] The While Album
[(ar)] Abbey Road
[(sgtp)] Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

Here's a survey multiple choice that lets you select more than one response. Which Beatles albums do you love super hard?

[[rev]] Revolver
[[wa]] The While Album
[[ar]] Abbey Road
[[sgtp]] Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

Hints and follow-up explanations don't work for survey questions.


## Additional Resources

The last section of the module content should be a list of additional resources, both ours and outside sources, including links to other modules that build on this content or are otherwise related.

## Feedback

In the beginning, we stated some goals.

**Learning Objectives:**

@learning_objectives

We ask you to fill out a brief (5 minutes or less) survey to let us know:

* If we achieved the learning objectives
