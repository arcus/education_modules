## Brainstorming

"I'm not a math/data/musical/language/coding/artsy person."
"My brain doesn't work like that."
"I've never been any good at x."


"I'm a math/data/musical/language/coding/artsy person."
"It's just how my brain works."
"I've always been good at x."

Have you ever heard one of these sentences? Or said one yourself? Maybe a parent, teacher, or mentor has said one about themselves or about you.

These statements might have felt extremely true, and also comforting. It can feel nice to be good at something or have some innate talent, and a relief to be able to brush off activities or challenges as being not just outside of your comfort zone, but outside of your abilities.

All of these statements, and the attitudes attached to them, are part of a framework that psychologists call a **fixed mindset**.

In psychology, a **mindset** is a belief that influences how we act and react in a situation. Your mindset is not static, you can approach each task or activity with a different mindset.

<div class = "learnmore">
A lot of mindset research was done on human subjects from [W.E.I.R.D. countries](https://www.science.org/content/article/western-mind-too-weird-study) (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). The Psychology research community is starting to grapple with what conclusions gained from research on WEIRDos can be generalized to humans in general. However if you are here reading this module, I'm betting at least some of these things apply to you.
