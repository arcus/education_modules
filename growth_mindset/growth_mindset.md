title: Learning to Learn: Growth Mindset
comment:  What is a growth mindset is and how can it help you learn?
long_description: Learning new things can be hard work. Having an attitude that struggle and failure are not setbacks but a valuable part of the learning process can help you learn more. Yes, this sounds like a TED talk, and it is, but it is also a well studied area of metacognition. This module will introduce you to the concept of the growth mindset, present some of the research behind it, and give you some concrete steps to implement in your learning.

estimated_time: This is rough guess of how long it might take a learner to work through the module. It will print under "Estimated time to completion" in the overview


@learning_objectives  

After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- define "Growth Mindset"
- identify times when having a growth mindset has helped them learn new things
- differentiate between the popular culture idea of "Growth Mindset" and what the research shows.

## Mindset

In psychology, a **mindset** is a belief that influences how we act and react in a situation.

Your mindset is not static, you can approach each task or activity with a different mindset, or approach the same task with a different mindset on different occasions.

### Fixed Mindset

"I'm not a math/data/musical/language/coding/artsy person."
"My brain doesn't work like that."
"I've never been any good at that sort of thing."

"I'm a math/data/musical/language/coding/artsy person."
"It's just how my brain works."
"I've always been good at that sort of thing."

Have you ever heard one of these sentences? Or said one yourself? Maybe a parent, teacher, or mentor has said one about themselves or about you.

These statements might have felt extremely true, and also comforting. It can feel nice to be good at something or have some innate talent, and a relief to be able to brush off activities or challenges as being not just outside of your comfort zone, but outside of your abilities.

All of these statements, and the attitudes attached to them, are part of a framework that psychologists call a **fixed mindset**.

A fixed mindset is the belief that knowledge and skills are fixed, either due to innate talent or things that people learned earlier in their lives. This can hold you back, regardless of whether you think you are good or bad at something. Consider two people looking at a collection of complicated problems:

- "I'm already good at that type of problem, I don't want to try a harder one so I can maintain my perfect record!"
- "I'm never going to be good at that type of problem, so working on a small piece of it is a waste of my time."

Neither of these people are going to solve the hardest problems, nor will either learn anything new in the process.

### Growth Mindset

"Everyone who knows this had to learn it at some point, so I can learn it too."
"I have learned many new things in my life, so I can learn this new thing too."
"If I practice I will get better."
"If I fail, I will have learned something."


## Research findings

<div class = "learnmore">
A lot of mindset research was done on human subjects from [W.E.I.R.D. countries](https://www.science.org/content/article/western-mind-too-weird-study) (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). The Psychology research community is starting to grapple with what conclusions gained from research on WEIRDos can be generalized to humans in general. However if you are here reading this module, I'm betting at least some of these things apply to you.

## Quiz

1. What is something you understand or can do well that was very difficult when you first started learning it?
[[ ___ ]]

<details>

<summary>**One possible answer**</summary>

When you first learned to talk or communicate, you probably said a lot of nonsense for many years. But you kept trying until others understood you. Each attempt helped you be better at communicating, though you were likely very frustrated for a while.
