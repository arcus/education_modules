title: Learning to Learn: Growth Mindset
comment:  What is a growth mindset is and how can it help you learn?
long_description: Learning new things can be hard work. Having an attitude that struggle and failure are not setbacks but a valuable part of the learning process can help you learn more. Yes, this sounds like a TED talk, and it is, but it is also a well studied area of metacognition. This module will introduce you to the concept of the growth mindset, present some of the research behind it, and give you some concrete steps to implement in your learning.

estimated_time: This is rough guess of how long it might take a learner to work through the module. It will print under "Estimated time to completion" in the overview


@learning_objectives  

After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- define "Growth Mindset"
- identify times when having a growth mindset has helped them learn or do new things
- differentiate between the popular culture idea of "Growth Mindset" and what the research shows.

## Mindset

In psychology, a **mindset** is a belief that influences how we act and react in a situation.

Your mindset is not static, you can approach each task or activity with a different mindset, or approach the same task with a different mindset on different occasions.

### Fixed Mindset

"I'm not a math/data/musical/language/coding/artsy person."
"My brain doesn't work like that."
"I've never been any good at that sort of thing."

"I'm a math/data/musical/language/coding/artsy person."
"It's just how my brain works."
"I've always been good at that sort of thing."

Have you ever heard one of these sentences? Or said one yourself? Maybe a parent, teacher, or mentor has said one about themselves or about you.

These statements might have felt extremely true, and also comforting. It can feel nice to be good at something or have some innate talent, and a relief to be able to brush off activities or challenges as being not just outside of your comfort zone, but outside of your abilities.

All of these statements, and the attitudes attached to them, are part of a framework that psychologists call a **fixed mindset**.

A fixed mindset is the belief that knowledge and skills are fixed, either due to innate talent or things that people learned earlier in their lives. This can hold you back, regardless of whether you think you are good or bad at something. Consider two people looking at a collection of complicated problems with a fixed mindset:

- "I'm already good at that type of problem, I don't want to try a harder one so I can maintain my perfect record!"
- "I'm never going to be good at that type of problem, so working on a small piece of it is a waste of my time."

Neither of these people are going to solve the hardest problems, nor will either learn anything new in the process.

### Growth Mindset

"Everyone who knows this had to learn it at some point, so I can learn it too."
"I have learned many new things in my life, so I can learn this new thing as well."
"If I practice I will get better."
"If I fail, I will learn something in the process."

All of these statements, and the attitudes attached to them, are part of a framework that psychologists call a **growth mindset**.

A growth mindset is the belief that "basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard workâ€”brains and talent are just the starting point." [^1] This can help you expand your skills regardless of whether you think you are good or bad at something. Consider two people looking at a collection of complicated problems with a growth mindset:

- "I'm already good at that type of problem, so I'm going to see what I can learn from trying a different or harder type of problem."
- "I don't know how to do that type of problem **yet** so I am going to break it into smaller chunks while I'm learning about it."

Both of these people are going to come away from working on the problems with more knowledge and understanding than they started with. The first person might be able to solve a new type of problem, or identify how two types of problems differ, while the second person will be closer to solving the initial problem.

### Mindset flexibility

A mindset isn't an inherent trait, you can change your mindset whenever you want to!

I have changed my own mindset about the task of writing this module during the course of writing it. When I decided to write this module, I thought I knew enough about the theory of mindsets to put a decent module together. Then I started to outline it and immediately thought "actually I know less than I thought and should probably have asked someone else to write it, or possibly not suggested it in the first place." I was approaching it with a fixed mindset, that I either did or did not have the knowledge to write the module and if I didn't, then I shouldn't try. Practically I was not doing much more than typing section titles and immediately deleting them as not good enough.

But then I reminded myself that **I** should try applying a growth mindset the task of writing a module about growth mindset. Practically, that meant that I didn't try to outline the module before writing. Instead I typed up a lot of my disconnected thoughts, most of which I knew would not appear in the final version of the module. I Googled a lot of research papers about growth mindsets because I knew that through reading them I could better understand the scientific underpinnings of mindset theory. I decided to leave the title, description, and section headings of this module for last because the goal was no longer to create a finished module, but to learn more about growth mindset research so that I would eventually have the knowledge to create such a module. By reminding myself that a growth mindset was something I could have, I got unstuck.

I'm including this personal story as a precursor to the section on research, because it illustrates exactly what a lot of the mindset research shows: being reminded that the growth mindset framework exists is enough to shift a person's mindset in regards to a task or challenge. And that shift in mindset has measurable impacts on achievement.

## Growth Mindset Research

In 2006 Carol Dweck, a [professor of psychology at Stanford University](https://profiles.stanford.edu/carol-dweck), published her book "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success." It was a bestseller and many of its ideas have permeated the wider culture.

It has also been tested by peer reviewed research in the fields of Psychology and Education.

<div class = "learnmore">
A lot of mindset research was done on human subjects from [W.E.I.R.D. countries](https://www.science.org/content/article/western-mind-too-weird-study) (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). The Psychology research community is starting to grapple with what conclusions gained from research on WEIRDos can be generalized to humans in general. However if you are here reading this module, I'm betting at least some of these things apply to you.

### Selected Studies

There has been a lot of activity in the research of growth mindsets and neuroplasitcity since the early 2000s. Here is a selection of what has been learned:

**Having a growth mindset correlates with learning more**

**Being introduced to or reminded of the idea of neuroplasticity/growth mindset helps individuals learn more in subsequent exercises**

**Short introductions to the ideas of neuroplasticity/growth mindset can raise achievement in some groups in the longer term**

[National experiment on effectiveness of a one hour mindset intervention](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1466-y)

**Changing people's mindset for lasting growth isn't as easy as some studies hoped**

### Pop culture misconceptions

False growth mindset

Praise of effort that doesn't accomplish anything

## Quiz

[[ ___ ]]
***
<div class = "answer">
There are lots possible answers! If you are having trouble thinking of one, try think of things you do regularly that you could not have done when you were a small child. Perhaps riding a bike, driving a car, or navigating a bus system fall into this category.
