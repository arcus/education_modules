If you want to use R or python for data analysis but aren't sure how to write code for the statistical tests you want to run, this is a great place to start. This will be an especially valuable resource for people who have experience conducting analysis in other software (e.g. SAS, SPSS, MPlus, Matlab) and are looking to move to R and/or python. If you are new to data analysis, this module provides some structure to help you think about which statistical tests to run, and examples of code to execute them. It doesn't cover the statistical theory itself, though, so you'll need to do some additional reading before applying the code for any tests you don't already understand (there are recommended resources for learning statistical techniques at the end of the module)."

REDCap is a convenient and powerful way to collect and store research data.  This module will teach you how to interact with the REDCap API, or +Application Programming Interface,+ which can help you automate your data analysis. This will also help you understand APIs in general and what makes their use so appealing for reproducible research efforts."
