"pre_reqs": "\nLearners should have experience writing SQL code on single tables.  If you have successfully used a \"SELECT... FROM... WHERE\" SQL statement on a single table, and have at least seen \"GROUP BY\" commands in action, even if you would need help writing the GROUP BY code, you have enough code ability.  We also highly recommend that you understand the concepts of one-to-many data relationships and database normalization to get the most out of this module. \n\nIf you need to develop basic SQL fluency we recommend our module [SQL Basics](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/sql_basics/sql_basics.md#1).  For more intermediate topics, we suggest our module [SQL Intermediate](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/sql_intermediate/sql_intermediate.md#1).  Finally, to learn about one-to-many data relationships and database normalization, consider our [Database Normalization](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/database_normalization/database_normalization.md#1) module.\n\n",

If you want to use R or python for data analysis but aren't sure how to write code for the statistical tests you want to run, this is a great place to start. This will be an especially valuable resource for people who have experience conducting analysis in other software (e.g. SAS, SPSS, MPlus, Matlab) and are looking to move to R and/or python. If you are new to data analysis, this module provides some structure to help you think about which statistical tests to run, and examples of code to execute them. It doesn't cover the statistical theory itself, though, so you'll need to do some additional reading before applying the code for any tests you don't already understand (there are recommended resources for learning statistical techniques at the end of the module).",
