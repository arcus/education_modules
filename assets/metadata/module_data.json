"long_description": "If you've been curious about how to use Docker for your research, this module is a great place to start. The Docker 101 tutorial is a popular, hands-on approach to learning Docker that will get you using containers right away, so you can learn by doing. To help you bridge the gap between basic Docker use and best practices for using Docker in research, we also link to an article outlining 10 rules to help you create great containers for research, and lists of ready-to-use Docker images for a variety of analysis workflows. This module includes running and editing commands in the terminal, so you'll need some familiarity with bash. No prior experience with Docker or containers is assumed. ",
"pre_reqs": "This module assumes no prior experience *using* containers or Docker, but you should know what a container is.\n\nYou will also need some familiarity with working on the command line (bash).
