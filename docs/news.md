# News about the DART Program

## March 2023 Newsletter

**The Data and Analytics for Research Training (DART) Study Starts its First Wave of Participants**

We had over 300 people express interest in learning with the DART study and we started the inaugural 16 week study program on January 30th with more than 90 enrolled learners from over 20 different institutions. 

Many more will be eligible to participate in the next wave, which will start this summer. If you know anyone who might be interested in joining the program in a future wave, please have them fill out the [screening form](https://redcap.link/DART-survey).

**New Learning Content Available**

We have added a lot of new material since last summer’s pilot program. In addition to expanding and improving the content we already had for learning R, Python, SQL, Bash, and Git, we have also added modules about geospatial data, data management, citizen science, and more! Although custom pathways through the modules are only available to study participants, anyone can check out the [full list of available modules](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/list_of_modules) on our website. If you want to participate in the study and haven’t already screened, please fill out our [screener questionnaire](https://redcap.link/DART-survey). 

**More modules are currently being created and will be available soon!**

**Want to Contribute your own Expertise?**

We are always looking for experts willing to share their knowledge more broadly. Reach out to us at dart@chop.edu to start a discussion about the ways we help others learn what you already know!
