# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are the answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.  Click any question to see our answer, and submit new questions to [dart@chop.edu](mailto:dart@chop.edu).

## What is DART?

<details>
<summary>Is this a research study?</summary>
DART is a research study in which we provide biomedical researchers (our subjects) some data science training resources over the course of 16 weeks and measure the efficacy of our approach. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is leading this effort?</summary>
The main team that is creating the materials and conducting the research associated with this project is a team of data educators at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), with PIs hailing from CHOP and Drexel University.
</details>


## Do I Qualify?

<details>
<summary>Is this course designed for beginners with no experience in coding? </summary>
As far as the level of instruction, we are beginning our program with more basic instruction for brand new beginners, but subsequent cohorts (starting in late summer 2023) will also have the opportunity to study more complex topics like omics and machine learning.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can learners join the training without engagement in a research project?</summary>
This program is intended for people who are actively involved in the conduct of research, so if you’re not participating at that level, then you wouldn't (yet) qualify for this study. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>I got an email telling me I'm ineligible.  Why?</summary>
It can be frustrating to wonder why you were ineligible for the DART program.

Although we generally try to be as transparent as we can with all our communication, we can't share the reason someone was excluded from participating in the research study.  We have unfortunately experienced people trying to re-enroll with changed answers when we explain our inclusion and exclusion criteria.  As fellow learners, we want to explain why you were excluded, but as researchers we have a duty to maintain the rigor of our study.
</details>


## Logistical Details

<details>
<summary>Is this training on site or remote?</summary>
This is a remote/online opportunity that can be undertaken anywhere you have a reliable internet connection.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is attendance required at any group meetings during the 4-month program?</summary>
We place learners in "communities of practice" with other learners and encourage them to interact.  We anticipate that most or all of this interaction may be asynchronous, but it's possible that some people might want to put together a synchronous (or even in-person) chat, code exercise group, or similar.  Your participation in any community of practice event is optional (but potentially fun and useful).
</details>

<details>
<summary>If I do not feel this is a good fit for me, is there any obligation that would stop me from dropping?</summary>
As with any study, you can drop out for any reason and there is no harm done – we won't hold it against you, tell your boss, or email your thesis advisor.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>If I do drop out can I re-enroll at a future time?</strong></summary>
You can only enroll in the study as a research subject once. You can continue learning on your own at your convenience, since you will retain access to all of the educational materials and the learning pathway you were assigned. You will not, however, be eligible to join another cohort.
</details>


<details>
<summary>Does "free standing, asynchronous, practically focused" mean that you can do each session at a time of your own choosing or is there a schedule for these sessions?</summary>
You can do these training modules at your leisure, but we do suggest a sequence and ask you to do 2-3 hours a week of effort, knowing that sometimes you’ll have more time and sometimes less.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you anticipate offering another 4-month training program later this year?</summary>
Yes, we plan another session later in the year, starting in July or August of 2023.
</details>

## Curriculum

<details>
<summary>Will the DART program be useful when using Excel and STATA?</summary>
We have a strong emphasis on free, open source software (this does not include Stata or Excel).  Our course materials don't include instructions on Excel or Stata, but some of the principles we teach may be useful in data cleaning and preparation, regardless of how you do it.
