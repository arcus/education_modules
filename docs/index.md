# Data and Analytics Researcher Training Program (DART)

The DART Program aims to provide free, open source, just in time educational materials to help working researchers gain the data science knowledge to expand and improve upon the work they are already doing.

These materials have been created for the purpose of sharing them widely with the research community.
