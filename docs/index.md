# Data and Analytics for Research Training Research Study (DART)

The DART Research Study aims to provide free, open source educational materials to help working biomedical researchers gain the data science knowledge to expand and improve upon the work they are already doing.  The research study includes:

* Data science training materials, presented in a custom learning pathway that is based on learner needs
* A community of learners to provide peer support throughout the learning experience.

Because we believe that there are many learners who are not participating in our research who could benefit from our data science learning materials, 
we have opted to share these materials widely with the research community.
