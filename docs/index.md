# Data and Analytics for Research Training (DART)

The DART program provides free, open source educational materials to help working biomedical researchers gain the data science knowledge to expand and improve upon the work they are already doing. 

The program consists of instructional modules which teach data science and related skills to researchers, in alignment with the NIH emphasis on improving research reproducibility, transparency, and rigor. 

> Our team values a modular educational approach, where learners get just the training they need and can select from various modules to assemble their own learning pathway. 

We invite you explore [pre-made educational pathways](example_pathways) or [build your own pathway with our prototype module discovery application](https://learn.arcus.chop.edu). You can also browse the [full list of our educational modules](list_of_modules).

## Contributors

The founding contributors to this project are members of the [Arcus](https://arcus.chop.edu) team at [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu).

We invite and encourage you to help in any way you feel you can, from letting us know about typos and bugs to [writing entire new modules](https://github.com/arcus/education_modules/blob/main/how_to.md). If you are interested in contributing to this project, visit the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arcus/education_modules) for more information.

## Thanks

This project is grateful for the generosity of [Liascript](https://github.com/LiaScript)'s creators and sustainers, Andr√© Dietrich and Sebastian Zug, for sharing their work (and advice!) freely.

## DART Research Study 2021-2023

We ran a research study to measure the effectiveness of this program. The research study included:

* Data science training materials, presented in a custom learning pathway that is based on learner needs
* A community of learners to provide peer support throughout the learning experience.

For updates about our findings, see [News](news).

### Funders

DART is funded by the National Institutes of Health award number 5R25GM141501.
