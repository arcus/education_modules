# DART: Information for Learners

Do you want to learn more about how data science can help your research? Or learn how to get started programming in R or Python? This program is for you!

## Joining a Cohort

If you are interested in getting a guided curriculum and a cohort of fellow learners, we will be putting together communities of practice to research the effectiveness of these materials in accordance with the NIH R25 grant funding this project. We do not yet have a timeline for when we will be able to start recruiting participants.

## Independent Exploration

We understand that waiting for a cohort and guided curriculum might be too long to wait. You are welcome to explore [these materials](list_of_modules) on your own, but doing so will exclude you from being able to participate in a cohort in the future.
