# Try out our self-paced learning modules!

Our modules are designed to be flexible and bite-sized, so you can use your time efficiently and pick just the topics you want to study. 
Each module has learning objectives and prerequisites clearly listed on the first page, to help you decide which ones you want to work on. 

That said, many learners prefer to start with a curated list of suggestions, rather than browsing through the modules on their own.
If you're trying to figure out how to get started with DART, see if one of the suggested pathways below sounds like a good fit!

## Pathway 1: Getting started with biomedical data science

This popular pathway is designed with new data scientists in mind. 
You might be early in your research career, or you might have years of experience but just trying out data science techniques for the first time. 

This pathway provides a practical overview of what skills you'll need to do reproducible, rigorous data science research in biomedical and health fields. 
We'll touch on a lot of the hot topic techniques you may have heard about (what exactly are large language models?) and help you cut through the hype to figure out whether those are tools you want to invest time in learning. 

If you're at the point where you know you're interested in biomedical data science but aren't sure where to start, this is the pathway for you!
