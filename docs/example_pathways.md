# Try out our self-paced learning modules!

Our modules are designed to be flexible and bite-sized, so you can use your time efficiently and pick just the topics you want to study. 
Each module has learning objectives and prerequisites clearly listed on the first page, to help you decide which ones you want to work on. 

That said, many learners prefer to start with a curated list of suggestions, rather than browsing through the modules on their own.
If you're trying to figure out how to get started with DART, see if one of the suggested pathways below sounds like a good fit!

## Pathway 1: Getting started with biomedical data science

This popular pathway is designed with new data scientists in mind. 
You might be early in your research career, or you might have years of experience but just trying out data science techniques for the first time. 

This pathway provides a practical overview of what skills you'll need to do reproducible, rigorous data science research in biomedical and health fields. 
We'll touch on a lot of the hot topic techniques you may have heard about (what exactly are large language models?) and help you cut through the hype to figure out whether those are tools you want to invest time in learning. 

If you're at the point where you know you're interested in biomedical data science but aren't sure where to start, this is the pathway for you!

## Pathway 2: Focus on omics

This pathway is for people who want to start working with molecular data. 
It will bring you up to speed in the computing tools you'll need to get started with genomics research, including using the command line, version control, and containerization. 
No computing background is assumed; we'll start from the basics!
Note that if you're already actively working on genomics analysis, this material will likely be too basic for you.

## Pathway 3: Big data, big questions

This pathway is for people primarily interested in analysis of the rich, complex data in the electronic health record (EHR) and other big databases. 
If you're interested in social determinants of health, retrospective analysis of clinical data, and connecting data from multiple sources, this is the pathway for you! 
This pathway includes a gentle but thorough introduction to SQL, the programming language you'll need to be able to work with databases, as well as information about geospatial data, text data, and more.

## Pathway 4: Analysis in R

This pathway is focuses on the skills and techniques you'll need to leverage the popular statistical programming language R. 
We'll start from zero and walk you through everything you need to start analyzing data in R, including lots of opportunities for hands-on practice. 

This is designed to be welcoming to folks with no coding experience, so if R will be your first programming language you'll fit right in!
