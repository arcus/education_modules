# All about the DART Program

## Goals

This repository holds publicly available instructional modules aimed at teaching data science and related skills to researchers, as part of an NIH emphasis on improving research reproducibility, transparency, and rigor.

These materials have been created for the purpose of sharing them widely with the research community.  

## Funders

DART is funded by the National Institutes of Health award number 5R25GM141501.

## Contributors

The founding contributors to this project are members of the [Arcus](https://arcus.chop.edu) team at [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu).

We invite and encourage you to help in any way you feel you can, from letting us know about typos and bugs to [writing entire new modules](https://github.com/arcus/education_modules/blob/main/how_to.md). If you are interested in contributing to this project, visit the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arcus/education_modules) for more information.
