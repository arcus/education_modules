## Lesson Preparation

Open a web browser, like Chrome or Firefox 

## Create a remote repository
Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to create a new repository called planets:

![github-create-repo-01](./assets/media/remotes_step_01_images/github-create-repo-01.png)

Name your repository “planets” and then click “Create Repository”.

Note: Since this repository will be connected to a local repository, it needs to be empty. Leave “Initialize this repository with a README” unchecked, and keep “None” as options for both “Add .gitignore” and “Add a license.” See the “GitHub License and README files” exercise below for a full explanation of why the repository needs to be empty.




## Additional Resources

The last section of the module content should be a list of additional resources, both ours and outside sources, including links to other modules that build on this content or are otherwise related.
