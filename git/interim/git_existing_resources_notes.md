# Git Notes


Notes for JP^2 to gather necessary resources to prepare the git education module.


## Existing Resources

* [Git 101](https://education.arcus.chop.edu/git-101/)
* [Git 102](https://education.arcus.chop.edu/git-102/)
* [Arcus Cataloging Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XVSnZSAYWpml4i5SpFtPiIl4tWWwUdkVhDYmbZDVkFc/edit#heading=h.anoqvlic7g4a)
  * Some sections include git commands within the mms-ide.
  * This may be of limited help since it has very strict context.
* [Github published docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

If relevant, you can include recommendations for somewhere else to start if the learner doesn't have these prereqs. For example: If you are brand new to R or python (or want a refresher) consider starting with [Intro to R](link) or [Intro to python](link) first and then coming back here.

## Gap Analysis

* Are there any major concepts missing from the existing resources? Can we find other materials to cover those gaps or do we need to create materials?
