# Git Notes


Notes for JP^2 to gather necessary resources to prepare the git education module.


## Existing Resources

* [Git 101](https://education.arcus.chop.edu/git-101/)
* [Git 102](https://education.arcus.chop.edu/git-102/)
* [Arcus Cataloging Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XVSnZSAYWpml4i5SpFtPiIl4tWWwUdkVhDYmbZDVkFc/edit#heading=h.anoqvlic7g4a)
  * Some sections include git commands within the mms-ide.
  * This may be of limited help since it has very strict context.
* [Github published docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)
* [Joy's slides for CI Fellows](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NPeWZzSEeE3wCynYXLzAN5WRkX63qvKX/edit#slide=id.p19)


## Module Prep Notes 20211209

### Gap Analysis

* Are there any major concepts missing from the existing resources? Can we find other materials to cover those gaps or do we need to create materials?  
* Don't be afraid of overlap and reminders
* Use lens of personas for outline?
  * individual workers who want to keep all their steps
  * groups that need to coordinate change
* 3 modules to start. Each module will be on its own branch in education_modules. Each JP will work on each subset of each module.
  * Demystifying Git/Github
    * What is it? Why use it?
  * Setting up Git
    * installation, signing up, various companies, BB GH, etc
  * Good Enough Git  
    * "Doing git badly"
    * focus on streamlined process for getting off the ground without necessarily using "best practices" yet
      * Set expectations for gatekeeping and bro culture in Git/Github and bracing yourself for stack overflow
    * mostly working in main, not branching all the time
    * not working with PRs
    * majority solo work
  * Others concepts/modules to cover or ideas to incorporate
    * git repos and the file system... what is git DOING?
    * git concepts: commits and branches -- when code needs to be updated and changed!
    * other git tools (VS Code, RStudio, Atom)
      * Aside -- we're opinonated about GH and teach this first....
