comment:  This is a short, focused description of the module.
long_description: This is a longer description, which should be understandable for a lay audience. It will print under "Is this module right for me?" in the overview.
estimated_time: This is rough guess of how long it might take a learner to work through the module. It will print under "Estimated time to completion" in the overview

@learning_objectives  

After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- describe data structures typical of EHR data, especially a 'normalized' database
- list three common sources of quality problems in EHR data
- identify statistical methods that are especially effective in analyzing EHR data

## Overview
@comment

**Is this module right for me?** @long_description

**Estimated time to completion:** @estimated_time

**Pre-requisites**

List any skills and knowledge needed to do this module here. When available, include links to resources, especially other modules we've made (to show learners where this falls within our catalog).

* one skill we have [another module for, linked here](https://education.arcus.chop.edu)
* some familiarity with [a topic](https://education.arcus.chop.edu)
* understanding of [one thing](https://education.arcus.chop.edu) and [another](https://education.arcus.chop.edu)

If relevant, you can include recommendations for somewhere else to start if the learner doesn't have these prereqs. For example: If you are brand new to R or python (or want a refresher) consider starting with [Intro to R](link) or [Intro to python](link) first and then coming back here.

**Learning Objectives**

@learning_objectives

For help articulating learning objectives, see [this guide to learning objectives, including lots of example verbs](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/).

## Why use EHR for research?

Electronic health records (EHR) are a large and growing source of data for medical researchers.
There are several advantages to EHR research over other data sources:

- no need to collect data or recruit participants
- large, representative sample
- potential for detailed longitudinal analyses
- potential for multi-site studies, replications, and generalizations


## Additional Resources

The last section of the module content should be a list of additional resources, both ours and outside sources, including links to other modules that build on this content or are otherwise related.

## Feedback

In the beginning, we stated some goals.

**Learning Objectives:**

@learning_objectives

We ask you to fill out a brief (5 minutes or less) survey to let us know:

* If we achieved the learning objectives
* If the module difficulty was appropriate
* If we gave you the experience you expected

We gather this information in order to iteratively improve our work.  Thank you in advance for filling out [our brief survey](https://redcap.chop.edu/surveys/?s=KHTXCXJJ93&module_name=%22EHR+Data%22)!

Remember to change the redcap link so that the module name is correct for this module!
