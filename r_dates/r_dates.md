# Dates in R

@overview

## Notes

https://education.arcus.chop.edu/date-pairing-in-r/

This article focuses on pairing dates specifically, glosses over what the date data types in R are and how they act. 
Does not use lubridate
Uses merge instead of e.g. left_join.
Uses a non-clinical data example (math and language test scores). Should put in more realistic example data.
