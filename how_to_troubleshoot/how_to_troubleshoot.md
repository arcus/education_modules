title: How to Troubleshoot
comment:  Learning to use technical methods like coding and version control in your research inevitably means running into problems.  Learn practical methods for troubleshooting and moving past error codes and other difficulties.
long_description: When technical methods, such as writing code, using version control, and creating data visualizations are used, there will moments when a cryptic error message appears or the code simply doesn't do what it was intended to do.  This module will help people at various levels of technical expertise learn how to troubleshoot in tech more effectively.
estimated_time: 1 hour

@learning_objectives  

After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- Learn to use web searches more effectively
- Explain why a "reproducible example" is critical to asking for help
- Find potentially helpful answers in Stack Overflow

## Overview
@comment

**Is this module right for me?** @long_description

**Estimated time to completion:** @estimated_time

**Pre-requisites**

This module assumes that learners have started using technical methods such as writing code.  However, this module is useful for learners at any stage of adoption of reproducible methods in research such as scripting and version control.

**Learning Objectives**

## First, Don't Panic

Some technical types (including the author of this module) are also fans of *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, so we begin with a quote from that illustrious text.

> Ford handed the book to Arthur.
"What is it?" asked Arthur.
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic book. It tells you everything you need to know about anything. That's its job."
Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands. "I like the cover," he said. "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day."

While not even the entirety of the Internet can promise to tell you **everything** you need to know about technology, we do believe that the slogan "Don't Panic" is a useful one.  Technology can be baffling, inconsistent, and frustrating, and lead its users to experience rage or fear or feel incompetent.  If you feel this way, you're not alone, and there are practical steps to troubleshooting we'll share with you in this module to help you feel more empowered.  Try not to panic!

The "steps" we're describing in this module don't necessarily take place in the order we describe -- often there's a flow from one method to another and back again as you get closer and closer to understanding, describing, and solving any problems you encounter in tech.  And you may have tips and ideas we haven't mentioned here, too.  Please share those with us at dart@chop.edu!
