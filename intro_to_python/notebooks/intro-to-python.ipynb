Indents indicate blocks of code, or lines of code that do a specific thing. In this case, the two lines after the `for` statement are in a different code block than the rest; they comprise the body of the loop. Indentation tells Python what statements to evaluate in what order. You also may have noticed a colon (`:`) at the end of the `for` statement. This tells Python that the following lines are a new code block and should be indented. Jupyter helps you out by automatically indenting the following lines until you give it an unindented line (like `candy_day1` at the end of the code chunk above). Be careful not to add any extra spaces! All of the lines of a code block need to be indented the same number of spaces.  \n",
