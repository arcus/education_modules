title: Module Title
comment:  This module is a brief introduction to geospatial (location) data.
long_description: This module will survey some of the benefits of using geospatial data for research purposes. No previous exposure to geospatial data is expected. If you have any interest in maps or are wondering if using geospatial data might be helpful for your work, this lesson is designed to help you decide whether learning more about geospatial techniques is right for you and your project.
estimated_time: ??minutes

@learning_objectives  

After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- Identify geospatial data
- Describe some of the benefits of using geospatial data
-
- articulate the rationale for something

## What is Geospatial Data?

Maps and More!
Sometimes maps are helpful: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285922001814?via%3Dihub
Not all geospatial research results in maps: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11524-022-00633-7.pdf

## Classic example: John Snow and the Cholera Outbreak

https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/something-in-the-water-the-mythology-of-snows-map-of-cholera/

## Uses
Connections of all sort of not otherwise clear groupings (social determinants of health)
Effective interventions (i.e. put a clinic here)
Impactful communication, to both scientists and other interested people (general public/politicians/policy makers)

## Issues
Quality of data is greatly improved: hand drawn maps and surveying technology is now GPS, still not perfect
Volume of data: so freaking much all the time every day (think weather data)
Privacy: your cell phone is tracking you! Responsible use: jittering? By region? Can location data be anonymized?


## Additional Resources

The last section of the module content should be a list of additional resources, both ours and outside sources, including links to other modules that build on this content or are otherwise related.

## Feedback

In the beginning, we stated some goals.

**Learning Objectives:**

@learning_objectives

We ask you to fill out a brief (5 minutes or less) survey to let us know:

* If we achieved the learning objectives
* If the module difficulty was appropriate
* If we gave you the experience you expected

We gather this information in order to iteratively improve our work.  Thank you in advance for filling out [our brief survey](https://redcap.chop.edu/surveys/?s=KHTXCXJJ93&module_name=%22Demystifying+Geospatial+Data%22)!
