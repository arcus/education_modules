comment:  This module is a brief introduction to geospatial (location) data.
long_description: This module will survey some of the benefits of using geospatial data for research purposes. No previous exposure to geospatial data is expected. If you have any interest in maps or are wondering if using geospatial data might be helpful for your work, this lesson is designed to help you decide whether learning more about geospatial techniques is right for you and your project.

After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- Identify geospatial data
- Describe some of the benefits of using geospatial data
-
- articulate the rationale for something

## What is Geospatial Data?

If you have ever look at a map, followed GPS directions, or even just used a cell phone to check the time, you have used geospatial data.

**Geospatial Data** is any data that includes information about the location of an object or event on the Earth. We think of these locations as being on the Earth's surface, but they might actually be a bit above the surface (weather, airplane flight paths) or below (oil or gas deposits).    

Most useful geospatial data includes locations in addition to other information.

Many of our interactions with geospatial data are in the form of maps. Maps can be visually striking ways to present a lot of geospatial data.


### Classic example: London's 1854 Cholera Outbreak

In the mid 1800s, the modern idea of germ theory was still in its nascent stages, one of several competing ideas about how diseases spread. Learning how diseases spread, cholera in particular, was of great concern because cholera was traveling along global trade routes to become a pandemic.

Ultimately it was determined that cholera is an infection caused by a water-born bacteria, [Vibrio cholerae](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera). How did scientists figure out that cholera was spread by water? Using geospatial data!

In 1854, the city of London experienced an outbreak of cholera, with a particularly high number of cases among people who lived in near Broad Street in the Soho district. London had very good records of deaths and doctors, including one named John Snow, were able to put all of the cholera deaths on to a neighborhood map, shown below:

![Doctor John Snow's map of the 1854 cholera outbreak.](media/Snowmap1.png)

This map marks each cholera death as a dark bar at the deceased's address. If an address has multiple deaths from cholera, the bars stack to form a version of a bar graph.

One (fictional) version of this story says that Dr. Snow created this map and had a "eureka" moment! On seeing the map he knew that the center of this area was a particular water pump, and heroically removed the handle of the pump preventing any more people from accessing the infected water and halting the spread of disease. 

In reality, while he did identify the water pump as a possible source of the outbreak, Dr. Snow informed the local authorities who removed the pump about a month after the outbreak started. The map wasn't created until later when Dr. Snow was trying to prove his hypothesis about the pump.

The


The map made by a doctor named John Snow documenting cases of Cholera in the Soho district of London in 1854 is a go-to example of how powerful geospatial data can be in the world of health. While it was far from the first such map, or even the first such map of that particular outbreak.

### More than Maps

While maps can be an extremely effective way to display geospatial data, not all geospatial is easily represented by maps, nor are maps the most effective way to study some questions.

For example, a study by the CHOP Policy Lab used geospatial data both about participant addresses and the locations of trees throughout the city of Philadelphia to study how exposure to trees impacts stress levels.  

While this study relies heavily on geospatial data, it doesn't include any maps. Instead, the researchers process the location information they have about both participants and trees to plot an individual's stress level in terms of that individual's proximity to trees.


Sometimes maps are helpful: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285922001814?via%3Dihub


Not all geospatial research results in maps: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11524-022-00633-7.pdf

## The power of geospatial data

### Connections
of all sort of not otherwise clear groupings (including social determinants of health)

### Effective interventions
(i.e. put a clinic here)

### Impactful communication
to both scientists and other interested people (general public/politicians/policy makers)

## Issues impacting geospatial data
Quality of data is greatly improved: hand drawn maps and surveying technology is now GPS, still not perfect

### Volume of data
so freaking much all the time every day (think weather data)

### Privacy
your cell phone is tracking you! Responsible use: jittering? By region? Can location data be anonymized?

### Expense
some things are free, but for really powerful stuff, you need to pay a lot of money.

## Additional Resources

The last section of the module content should be a list of additional resources, both ours and outside sources, including links to other modules that build on this content or are otherwise related.

## Feedback

In the beginning, we stated some goals.

**Learning Objectives:**

@learning_objectives

We ask you to fill out a brief (5 minutes or less) survey to let us know:

* If we achieved the learning objectives
* If the module difficulty was appropriate
* If we gave you the experience you expected

We gather this information in order to iteratively improve our work.  Thank you in advance for filling out [our brief survey](https://redcap.chop.edu/surveys/?s=KHTXCXJJ93&module_name=%22Demystifying+Geospatial+Data%22)!
