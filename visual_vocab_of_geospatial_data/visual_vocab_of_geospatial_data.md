title: Maps: the Visual Vocabulary of Geospatial Data
comment:  This is a general overview of how geospatial data can be presented visually using maps.
long_description: Although maps can be extremely effective ways to receive information with limited specialized knowledge, creating them requires some specialized vocabulary. This modules if for learners who want to move beyond reading maps and are considering making their own maps.
estimated_time: ?? minutes

After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- specify mapping conventions
- describe types of geospatial data
- identify common types of maps

## The power of maps

Pros of maps:

don't need a lot of specialized knowledge to understand them
meanings persist throughout time, check out these really old maps!
some conventions: land/water is a convention worth keeping, north = up maybe less so

Issues to consider:

maps can distort information just as much as any other way of presenting data. Because they are so striking, perhaps even more so!
remember, visual means very accessible for SOME, but not universally accessible. If your ONLY way of communicating the information is with a map, it will be less accessible to completely inaccessible to those with different vision.  

## What makes up a map?

points, lines, and polygons, multipolygons. (state of delaware has a circular bump how is that pologon-ized?)

## Ways maps can present data

choropleth (and variantions)
dot distribution
graduated symbol
heat Maps
cartogram (kind of a weird one...)

## Feedback

In the beginning, we stated some goals.

**Learning Objectives:**

We ask you to fill out a brief (5 minutes or less) survey to let us know:

* If we achieved the learning objectives
* If the module difficulty was appropriate
* If we gave you the experience you expected

We gather this information in order to iteratively improve our work.  Thank you in advance for filling out [our brief survey](https://redcap.chop.edu/surveys/?s=KHTXCXJJ93&module_name=%22Module+Template%22)!

Remember to change the redcap link so that the module name is correct for this module!
