From the help documentation:

> ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram, is a procedure performed by threading an endoscope through the mouth to the opening in the duodenum where bile and pancreatic digestive juices are released into the intestine. ERCP is helpful for treating blockages of flow of bile (gallstones, cancer), or diagnosing cancers of the pancreas, but has a high rate of complications (15-25%).
> The occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis is a common and feared complication, as pancreatitis can result in multisystem organ failure and death, and can occur in ~ 16% of ERCP procedures.
> The inflammatory cytokine storm that can result from this procedural complication can be quite severe. Several small randomized trials suggested that anti-inflammatory NSAID therapies at the time of ERCP could reduce the rate of this complication, but all were rather small single-center studies, and were not sufficiently convincing to change practice.

### Writing the formula

### Link functions

### Summarize the results

Note that R prints the results such that the first level of the outcome variable is a failure, so these results articulate the probability of the second level of statement.included happening. 
To see the order of the levels in the data frame, use levels()

```r
model.sum <- summary(logit.model1)
pander(model.sum)
```

\seealso{the stargazer package, which makes lovely model tables and works for knitting to pdf but not Word}
\seealso{knitr has a function for making tables, kable(), but it doesn't work for model summaries}

### Testing a series of models

It's typical to test a series of glms, beginning with a null model (no predictors).

```r
logit.model0 <- glm(statement.included ~ 1, data=osf.lgt,
                    family=binomial(link="logit"),
                    na.action=na.exclude)
```

Use anova() to test for a significant improvement in model fit from the null model to our test model:

```r
anova(logit.model0, logit.model1, test="Chisq") 
```

Since we want to test for a significant change in model fit (deviance), we'll used a chi-squared test.

### Classification tables

For logistic regression, it's nice to have a classification table showing your model's predicted outcomes compared to the actual outcome.

```r
osf.lgt$pred1 <- predict(logit.model1, 
                                osf.lgt, 
                                type="response") 

osf.lgt$pred0 <- predict(logit.model0, 
                                 osf.lgt, 
                                 type="response") 
```

Note that if you leave out the `type="response"` argument, or enter `type="link"` instead, it will give you predicted logits instead of predicted probabilities.


Set a probability cutoff (let's use .5). Probabilities above this will be classified as "yes", and below will be classified as "no".

```r
osf.lgt$clas0 <- ifelse(osf.lgt$pred0 >= .5, 1,
                                ifelse(osf.lgt$pred0 < .5, 0, 
                                       NA))
osf.lgt$clas1 <- ifelse(osf.lgt$pred1 >= .5, 1,
                                ifelse(osf.lgt$pred1 < .5, 0, 
                                       NA))
```

Convert the new classification variables to factors, for cleaner output in the crosstabs.

```r
osf.lgt$clas0 <- factor(osf.lgt$clas0,
                                levels=c(1,0),
                                labels=c("yes", "no"))
osf.lgt$clas1 <- factor(osf.lgt$clas1,
                                levels=c(1,0),
                                labels=c("yes", "no"))
```

```r
xtabs(~ statement.included + clas0, data=osf.lgt)

xtabs(~ statement.included + clas1, data=osf.lgt)
```

### Plotting your logistic regression

The relationship between publication date and whether there was a data statement available

```r
ggplot(osf.lgt, aes(x=date, y=statement.included)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.3)
```

Note that R counts factor levels starting at 1, so "no" and "yes" are plotted at 1 and 2 respectively. To line them up with the predicted values from the model, we need to subtract 1.


```r
ggplot(osf.lgt, aes(x=date, y=as.numeric(statement.included)-1)) + 
  geom_point( alpha=.3 ) + 
  geom_line( aes(y=pred, x=date) ) +
  labs(y="Probability of providing a data statement")
```

### Adding more predictors

What question would this model test?

```r
logit.model2 <- glm(statement.included ~ date*Journal, data=osf.lgt,
                   family=binomial(link="logit"),
                   na.action=na.exclude)
```

Test against simpler models

```r
anova(logit.model0, logit.model1, logit.model2, test="Chisq") 
```

Getting predicted values

```r
osf.lgt$pred2 <- predict(logit.model2, 
                                osf.lgt, 
                                type="response") 
osf.lgt$clas2 <- ifelse(osf.lgt$pred2 >= .5, 1,
                                ifelse(osf.lgt$pred2 < .5, 0, 
                                       NA))
osf.lgt$clas2 <- factor(osf.lgt$clas2,
                                levels=c(1,0),
                                labels=c("yes", "no"))

xtabs(~ statement.included + clas2, data=osf.lgt)
```

```r
ggplot(osf.lgt, aes(x=date, y=as.numeric(statement.included)-1, 
                    color=Journal)) + 
  geom_point( alpha=.3 ) + 
  geom_line( aes(y=pred2, x=date) ) +
  labs(y="Probability of providing a data statement")
```
## Other kinds of GLMs

Let's say you wanted to see if the number of experiments reported in each article varies by journal. 

```r
summary(osf$Number.of.experiments)

hist(osf$Number.of.experiments)
```

There are a couple reasonable options for a link function here. Let's go with Poisson.

```r
osf.pois <- osf %>% 
  select(Number.of.experiments, Journal) %>% 
  filter(Journal != "Infant behavior & development") %>% 
  na.omit()
```

\hwydt{Write the glm call to model number of experiments by journal, using a Poisson link.}

```r
pois.model <- glm(Number.of.experiments ~ Journal, data=osf.pois,
                   family=poisson(link = "log"),
                   na.action=na.exclude)  
```

```r
ggplot(osf.pois, aes(x=Number.of.experiments)) + 
  geom_histogram() 
```

Show Journal info as well

```r
ggplot(osf.pois, aes(x=Number.of.experiments, fill=Journal)) + 
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(osf.pois, aes(x=Number.of.experiments, fill=Journal)) + 
  geom_density(alpha=.3, adjust=2) 
```

Try adding facet wrap by Journal as well, to put each density plot in its own facet.
