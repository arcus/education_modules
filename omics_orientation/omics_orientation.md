## What is "Omics"?

<div class = "learnmore">
Much of the content of this module was derived from an article by Hasin *et al.* published in the journal *Genome Biology*. The citation is below if you are interesting in reading more about this topic.

**Omics** is a suffix added to a large number of biological disciplines which denotes a "comprehensive, or global, assessment of a set of molecules" (Hasin et al., 2017) related to that domain.  Genomics is possibly the most well-known member of this family of disciplines, but is certainly not the only one! Omics has become something of a buzzword in recent years with the improvement of high-throughput technologies and increased ability to analyze large amounts of data.

Why study omics?
======

While studying single molecules or genetic loci is certainly valuable, biological processes and diseases are generally complicated and are rarely explained by variation in just one component of a system. Some diseases and disorders are polygenic (or resulting from changes in multiple genes), and many are believed to result from changes in gene regulation. Furthermore, these variations contribute to individual phenotypes in various ways; genetic background and environment play their own roles! In short, there are a lot of moving parts, and studying omics can give researchers a "global" view of biology, which can help explain such things as why some variants cause disease in some individuals and not others, or how the components of a biological system work together to form a whole.


## Omics topics

There are many "omics" topics that correspond to various biological domains. The following sections will discuss some of the most popular topics: genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics.

### Genomics

As the name suggests, genomics is the study of **genomes**. A genome is the complete genetic information of an organism, and so the study of genomics is generally focused on identifying and studying the effects of genetic variants. In medicine, this can lead to a better understanding of variation in response to pharmacological agents or disease prognoses. One type of genomics study that is commonly conducted is a **genome-wide association study** (GWAS) which, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute, is "a research approach used to identify genomic variants that are statistically associated with a risk for a disease or a particular trait" (https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome-Wide-Association-Studies#:~:text=A%20genome%2Dwide%20association%20study,disease%20or%20a%20particular%20trait). In these studies, "thousands of individuals are genotyped for more than a million genetic markers, and statistically significant differences in minor allele frequencies between cases and controls are considered evidence of association" (Hasin et al., 2017).

Genomics vs. genetics
=====

Though they are often mixed up or used interchangeably, genomics and genetics are distinct fields with different goals. Whereas genomics is the study of an organism's genome, or all of its genetic information, **genetics** is the study of specific genes (or parts of genes), their effects, and how they are inherited.

What about bioinformatics? Is that the same thing?
=====

Bioinformatics is another word that is often used interchangeably with genomics, but they are also not the same thing! Bioinformatics specifically refers to "using computer technology to collect, store, analyze and disseminate biological data and information, such as DNA and amino acid sequences or annotations about those sequences" (https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Bioinformatics). Bioinformatics makes the study of genomics and other omics disciplines possible.

### Transciptomics

An organism's **transcriptome** is the RNA that is transcribed from the DNA, and **transcriptomics** is the qualitative (what transcripts are present) and quantitative (how much of each transcript is present) study of these RNA transcripts. While some RNA transcripts are the template to be translated into proteins, it is becoming increasingly recognized that many RNA transcripts have important biological roles beyond encoding proteins! And while every cell in an organism has the same genome, the transcritome will vary from cell to cell populations and can change in response to changes in the environment, such as disease or treatment. The primary technologies for studying transcriptomics are **microarray**, in which RNA fragments of known sequences are bound to a surface (or "chip") and the amount of each fragment is quantified, and **RNA-Seq**, in which RNA sequences (which can be known or unknown) are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using **next-generation sequencing** (in which millions of sequences can be run at one time).

### Proteomics

Proteomics is the study of a cell's or organism's set of proteins. This involves not only quantifying how much of each protein is present, but also how they interact with each other and other molecules as well as how they are modified (a protein's function and regulation can often be affected by post-translation modifications). Like a cell's transcriptome, the **proteome** of a cell (or organism) is constantly changing in response to changing conditions. The most common high-throughput method of studying the proteome is **mass spectrometry** (often called mass spec), in which proteins or protein fragments are **ionized** (or charged) and then separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio. For more information about protein mass spectrometry, check out [this beginner's guide to protein mass spec](https://portlandpress.com/biochemist/article/42/5/64/226371/A-beginner-s-guide-to-mass-spectrometry-based).

### Other topics

A few other omics topics that you may come across include

* Epigenomics: The study of a cell or organism's **epigenome**, or the specific set of proteins and other molecules that bind to and regulate DNA.

* Metabolomics: The study of the set of small molecules in a cell known as **metabolites** that result from cellular metabolism.

* Microbiomics: The study of a system's microorganisms, such as those that live in the human digestive system.

## Multi-omics

>Each type of omics data, on its own, typically provides a list of differences associated with the disease. These data can be useful both as markers of the disease process and to give insight as to which biological pathways or processes are different between the disease and control groups.


As all of these biology domains that we have talked about so far are interconnected, it is perhaps not very surprising that there are circumstances in which it makes sense to take a **multi-omic** approach for a particular study. Biological processes are complex and can rarely be explained by just one set of molecules. Perhaps a disease-associated genomic variant might be due to contributions of differential regulation (the realm of transcriptomics) and/or changes in protein expression (which might be elucidated by proteomic analysis). A study into a specific disease might wish to catalog all of the various biological processes that are altered, from cellular metabolism to gene expression. There are a variety of ways in which multiple omics domains might contribute to a more thorough understanding of biological processes!

## Additional Resources

The website [genome.gov](genome.gov) has a variety of educational resources and infographics for reading more about various omics topics:

* The [About Genomics](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics) has overviews on genomes, genomics, and even a useful glossery of genomics-related terms.

* They also have [a brief overview of transcriptomics](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Transcriptome-Fact-Sheet)
