title: Data visualizations in seaborn
comment:  This module includes code and explanations for several popular data visualizations, using python's seaborn library. It also includes examples of how to modify seaborn plots to customize them for different uses (e.g. adhering to journal requirements for visualizations).  
long_description: This is a longer description, which should be understandable for a lay auidience. It will print under "Is this module right for me?" in the overview.

After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- identify key elements
- create a product
- do a task
- articulate the rationale for something

# Data visualizations in seaborn

<div class = "overview">

## Overview
@comment

**Is this module right for me?** @long_description

**Estimated time to completion:**

**Pre-requisites**

This module assumes some familiarity with principles of data visualizations as applied in the seaborn library. If you've used seaborn (or R's ggplot2) a little already and are just looking to extend your skills, this module should be right for you. If you are brand new to ggplot2 and seaborn, start with the overview of [data visualizations in open source software](link) first, and then come back here.

This module also assumes some basic familiarity with python, including

* [installing and importing libraries](link)
* [reading in data](link)
* manipulating data frames, including [calculating new columns](link), and [pivoting from wide format to long](link)
* some [statistical tests](link)

If you are brand new to python (or want a refresher) consider starting with [Intro to python](link) first.

**Learning Objectives**

## Lesson Preparation

This module makes use of [pangeo binder](https://binder.pangeo.io/) for interactive code examples in python. You don't need to install anything or set up an account, but you need a modern web browser like Chrome and a moderately good wifi connection. If you have python already installed on your computer and you prefer to work through code examples there, you can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/data_visualization_in_seaborn/data_visualization_seaborn.py" download>download the code for this module to run offline</a>.

If you intend to do the hands-on activities in this module with pangeo binder, we have a bit of preparation for you to do now. Because it can take a few minutes for the environment to be created, we suggest you click the link below to start up the activity. We recommend using right-click to open it in a new tab or window, and then returning here to continue learning while the environment finishes loading. Here is the link:

[![Link to start Binder environment](https://binder.pangeo.io/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/arcus/education_r_environment/main?urlpath=rstudio) **Click the "launch binder" button!**

You don't have to do anything except come back here once the link opens in a new tab or window.


## Additional Resources

The last section of the module content should be a list of additional resources, both ours and outside sources, including links to other modules that build on this content or are otherwise related.

## Feedback

In the beginning, we stated some goals.

**Learning Objectives:**

@learning_objectives

We ask you to fill out a brief (5 minutes or less) survey to let us know:

* If we achieved the learning objectives
* If the module difficulty was appropriate
* If we gave you the experience you expected

We gather this information in order to iteratively improve our work.  Thank you in advance for filling out [our brief survey](https://redcap.chop.edu/surveys/?s=KHTXCXJJ93&module_name=%22Data+Visualizations+in+Python%22)!
