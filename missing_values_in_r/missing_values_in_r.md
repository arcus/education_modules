title: Missing Values in R
comment:  A practical demonstration of how missing values show up in R and how to deal with them. Note that this module does **not** cover statistical approaches for handling missing data like imputation, but instead focuses on the code you need to work with and replace missing values in R.
long_description: Beginning introduction of how missing data is handled in R, what is NA, how to work with missing data values (in a very basic sense), typical default behavior, etc. For example, `remove_na()`, `replace_na()`, `fill()`, are missing values causing your error?, `na.rm=TRUE/FALSE`, other similar v concrete applicable stuff. Not covered: Imputation, assessing the impact of missing data on your analyses (in terms of validity, stats, etc), considering possible relatedness of missing data, etc.
estimated_time: 45 min

**Is this module right for me?** @long_description

**Estimated time to completion:** @estimated_time

**Pre-requisites**

List any skills and knowledge needed to do this module here. When available, include links to resources, especially other modules we've made (to show learners where this falls within our catalog).

* one skill we have [another module for, linked here](https://education.arcus.chop.edu)
* some familiarity with [a topic](https://education.arcus.chop.edu)
* understanding of [one thing](https://education.arcus.chop.edu) and [another](https://education.arcus.chop.edu)

If relevant, you can include recommendations for somewhere else to start if the learner doesn't have these prereqs. For example: If you are brand new to R or python (or want a refresher) consider starting with [Intro to R](link) or [Intro to python](link) first and then coming back here.

**Learning Objectives**

## The data

## What does "missing" look like in R?

## How to check for missing values

## Reading in data with missing values

## Working around missing values

## Filtering out missing values

## Additional Resources

The last section of the module content should be a list of additional resources, both ours and outside sources, including links to other modules that build on this content or are otherwise related.

## Feedback

In the beginning, we stated some goals.

**Learning Objectives:**

@learning_objectives

We ask you to fill out a brief (5 minutes or less) survey to let us know:

* If we achieved the learning objectives
* If the module difficulty was appropriate
* If we gave you the experience you expected

We gather this information in order to iteratively improve our work.  Thank you in advance for filling out [our brief survey](https://redcap.chop.edu/surveys/?s=KHTXCXJJ93&module_name=%22Missing+Values+in+R%22)!

Remember to change the redcap link so that the module name is correct for this module!
