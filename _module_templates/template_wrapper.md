## Lesson Preparation

This module will direct you to external educational content.
---

Many topics have great content written by others! We chose this content for you based on how well it meets our criteria.

Not all selected materials will meet all of these criteria, but selected materials should meet as many as possible.
Write a short sentence about how this material meets, or does not meet, each criterion.

The structure of this module:
---
Give learners a short, concrete, description of what they will do. This might look like:

Example Structure 1:

1. Read about how this topic fits into some bigger picture here in this LiaScript course.
2. Do the activities embedded in this module (using iFrames).
3. Answer a few questions to make sure you understood the key parts.

Example Structure 2:

1. Open this external resource in a new browser window.
2. Read Chapter 1 and do the activities at the end.
3. Return to this LiaScript course to answer a few questions to make sure you understood the key parts.

Example Structure 3:

1. Open this external resource in a new browser window.
2. Read Section 2.1 and 2.2.
3. Return to this LiaScript course to do an activity.
4. Answer a few questions (again in the LiaScript course) to make sure you understood the key parts.
These are just some examples of possible structures. The specific structure will depend greatly on the particular external module/educational resource you are using.

Wrapper modules may or may not include much text in the LiaScript file itself. 
For instructions and examples about including embedded media, highlight boxes, math, code, and quiz questions, see the [standard module template](https://github.com/arcus/education_modules/blob/main/_module_templates/standard_module_template.md).
