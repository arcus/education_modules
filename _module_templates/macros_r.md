Please do this step now, because we're going to ask you to follow along throughout and try out code as you go.  

<div class = "important">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Important note</b><br>

Please read over all the options before you start performing any actions, to make sure you pick the right option for you.

</div>

### Option 1: Use Posit Cloud

Posit (the company formerly known as RStudio) provides a multi-tiered cloud environment for using RStudio.  This option requires you to have an account with Posit Cloud, their online RStudio server.  The good news is that the base level of Posit Cloud is free!

First, you'll need to [create a (free!) Posit cloud account](https://posit.cloud/plans).  

Then, once you're logged in at [https://posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud), open the "education\_r\_environment" project at [https://posit.cloud/content/5273350](https://posit.cloud/content/5273350).  That will give you a temporary copy so you can run our code, but not make any changes to it.

In the file area to the lower right, you'll see, among multiple choices, the folder called "@r_file".  That's the code for this module!

Click on "Save a Permanent Copy" if you want to save any changes to your version of this code.

<img src="https://github.com/arcus/education_r_environment/blob/main/media/make_copy.png?raw=true" alt="Posit menu bar with 'Make Permanent Copy'." style = "border: 1px solid rgb(var(--color-highlight)); clear:both;">

Now you can not only work in the cloud, but also save your work.

### Option 2: Work on Your Computer, Using Git

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>

If you use Git or would like to, or you want to keep up to date with improvements we make to our R instructions, you will want to use this option.  There's a third option for those who are not interested in getting access to updates and just want to download the current version of our R instruction.

</div>

If you have R and RStudio installed already on your local computer, you might be interested in simply downloading our sample code to your computer. Here's how, using Git.  Note: If you've already done this step in another module, you might have the material for this module already!

<div class = "important">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Important note</b><br>

**Setting up RStudio the first time**

If this is your first time using RStudio on your computer, you'll likely need to download and install some software, which may take a little time. 
You'll only have to do this once, though. 

First, you'll need to install both R and RStudio. 
The [install page for RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) includes up-to-date links for both R and RStudio and should default to the correct versions for your operating system; follow the instructions there.

If you're working on a Windows computer, you'll also need Git installed. 
If you don't already have Git on your computer, check out our instructions for how to [download Git for Windows](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/git_setup_windows/git_setup_windows.md#downloading-git).

Not sure if you already have Git installed or not? 
If you know how to use [the command line](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/bash_command_line_101/bash_command_line_101.md#1) on your computer, try running the command `git --version`. 
If you have Git installed, it will tell you the version number. 
If you don't yet have Git installed, you'll get an error. 

</div>

<div class = "help">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Troubleshooting help</b><br> 

If you're running into problems with installation on your computer, the most thorough and helpful guide we know is in [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro).
Take a look at the detailed instructions there, and you may be able to figure out what's going wrong with your install.

Installation problems can be tricky to solve, though, since so much depends on what the existing configuration of your computer is like.

If you're stuck, reach out and ask for help! While the authors of these modules can't provide support for software installations, you may find assistance through [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), a local user group (for instance, if your university or employer has an R User Group), or the IT department at your institution. Learning how to ask for help effectively is its own challenge: may we suggest our module [How to Troubleshoot](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/how_to_troubleshoot/how_to_troubleshoot.md#1) for tips?

</div>

* In RStudio, open a new project (File, New Project)
* Select Version Control, then Git
* Drop this link into the "Repository URL": https://github.com/arcus/education_r_environment
* Change the "Project directory name" and "Create project as a subdirectory of" boxes to suit your needs (where will this code be stored on your computer?).
* Click to select the "Open in new session" checkbox
* Click "Create Project"
* In the file area to the lower right, you'll see, among multiple choices, the folder called "@r_file".  That's the code for this module!

If you already completed this work for a previous module, and it's been a while since you downloaded this project to your computer, you may want to get any new and improved files that have been placed there in the meantime:

* Open your project.
* In the Version Control menu, choose "pull branches".  There are two places to do this, as shown below:

<img src="https://github.com/arcus/education_r_environment/blob/main/media/pull_branches.png?raw=true" alt="Git button menu with choices to pull and push branches." style = "border: 1px solid rgb(var(--color-highlight)); max-width:400px;">

<img src="https://github.com/arcus/education_r_environment/blob/main/media/pull_branches_2.png?raw=true" alt="Tools menu with choices to pull and push branches." style = "border: 1px solid rgb(var(--color-highlight)); max-width:400px;">

<div class = "warning">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Warning!</b><br>

If you're pulling branches after having worked in other R modules, you might have made local changes (for example, when you filled in exercise code) that will be overwritten by pulling the latest version.  If you want to save your changes, consider making a copy of any exercise files and naming them something new.  For example, if you have already worked in the `r_basics_example` exercise files, you might want to save your version of `example_exercises.Rmd` to `my_example_exercises.Rmd`.  That way, you can pull down the latest version of code, overwriting `example_exercises.Rmd` while holding on to your changes in the new file.

</div>

### Option 3: Work on Your Computer, Avoiding Git

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>

If you use Git or would like to, or you want to keep up to date with improvements we make to our R instructions, you will want to use Option 2, not this option.  This option exists for those who are not interested in getting access to updates and just want to download the current version of our R instruction.

</div>

If you have R and RStudio installed already on your local computer, you might be interested in simply downloading our sample code to your computer. Here's how to do that, avoiding the use of Git.  Note: If you've already done this step in another module, you might have the material for this module already!

<div class = "important">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Important note</b><br>

**Setting up RStudio the first time**

If this is your first time using RStudio on your computer, you'll likely need to download and install some software, which may take a little time. 
You'll only have to do this once, though. 

</div>

First, you'll need to install both R and RStudio. 
The [install page for RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) includes up-to-date links for both R and RStudio and should default to the correct versions for your operating system; follow the instructions there.

Second, you'll want to download our R instructional files.  To do that:

* Go to https://github.com/arcus/education_r_environment and click on the green "Code" button (see below). 
* A menu will appear below.  Choose "Download ZIP" (see below).

<img src="https://github.com/arcus/education_r_environment/blob/main/media/download_zip.png?raw=true" alt="Git button menu with choices to pull and push branches." style = "border: 1px solid rgb(var(--color-highlight)); max-width:400px;">

A compressed (zip) file will be saved wherever your browser is set up to save (for example, many people have their browser use a folder called Downloads).

Find this file, which should have a title like `education_r_environment-main.zip` and move it to wherever you want in your file system.  Once you have it where you want it, you can "unzip" that file by double-clicking it.  You'll now have a folder/directory that's titled something like `education_r_environment-main`, and if you want, you can change the title of that folder/directory.

Now, open RStudio.  

* In RStudio, open a new project (File, New Project)
* Choose "Existing Directory"
* Use the File Browser to browse to the location of your directory (the one you created by unzipping the zipped file).
* Click to select the "Open in new session" checkbox
* Click "Create Project"
* In the file area to the lower right, you'll see, among multiple choices, the folder called "@r_file".  That's the code for this module!
