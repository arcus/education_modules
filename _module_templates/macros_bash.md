You will get the most out of this lesson if you follow along with the examples and try out the commands. In order to do that you need to have a bash shell open on your computer. Please follow the instructions appropriate for the computer you are using.

**Open a bash shell.**
If you are using a computer with running a Unix operating system (i.e. a Mac or Linux computer) you can use the **Terminal** program. If you are on a computer using Windows, open either **WLS** (Windows Linux Subsytem) or **Git Bash**. If you don't have these programs there are instructions for how to download and set them up in the [Bash / Command Line 101](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/bash_command_line_101/bash_command_line_101.md#windows-computers) module.

It can be stressful to interact with files directly from the command line. Throughout this module we will make sure you know what each command does before asking you to do it.  Like any other computational skill, you'll get more comfortable with it the more you practice!

</div>

To ensure that we aren't touching any of the important files on your computer, you will be downloading a small directory to experiment with.  You can download a fresh copy to start over at any point. 

<div class = "warning">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Warning!</b><br>

Please download a fresh copy of these files. If you have downloaded them for a previous module, you have likely moved and changed some of them while working through that module and the examples in this module assume that no changes have already been made to the directory.

</div>

**Download the files.**

Download the [`learning_bash` directory](https://github.com/arcus/learning_bash) from GitHub. Once you go to the link:

1. Click on the green **Code** drop-down button towards the right-hand side of the screen. 

2. Select **Download ZIP** from the options that appear.

3. Once the Zip file has downloaded, un-zipping it will create a folder titled `learning_bash-main`. Depending on your computer's operating system, you may be able to un-zip the folder by double clicking on it, or may need to right click on it a select "Extract All." This may create an identically named folder inside `learning_bash-main` that contains all of the individual files.
4. [Find out the file path](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/directories_and_file_paths/directories_and_file_paths.md#6) (location on your computer) of the new folder `learning_bash-main` and navigate there in your command line interface.

**Where is my folder?**

If you can see the icon for your `learning_bash-main` folder (maybe in a downloads screen) you can open your command line interface directly into the folder by right clicking on the folder and selecting the appropriate option:

| Command Line Interface | Right-click menu option |
| :- | :- |
| Terminal (Mac or Linux) | New Terminal at Folder |
| Git Bash (Windows) | Git Bash Here |
| WLS (Windows Linux Subsystem) | Open Linux shell here |

This will open a command line interface at the correct location. Once there, you can use the command `pwd` to see the path to your present working directory.
